* server data

server data is like a router, it contains all other endpoint for the server and login
it also contains some metadata needed for login

host: www.growtopia1.com, www.growtopia2.com
endpoint: /growtopia/server_data.php

1. growtopia requests https://www.growtopia1.com/growtopia/server_data.php
    header:
        {'Host': 'www.growtopia1.com', 'User-Agent': 'UbiServices_SDK_2022.Release.9_PC64_ansi_static', 'Accept': '*/*', 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'Content-Length': '36'}
    body:
        version=5.38&platform=0&protocol=219

2. hosts configuration routes that endpoint to our local https server
3. intercept the response

We will be back online shortly. Thank you for your patience!\nmeta|VOZ5jj5wgJAHsPD9EIBYrWFWJwQ4jmm4g55rtFxrBUY=\nRTENDMARKERBS1001

4. change the server host and port to our local enet server, send back the modified response

* enet

for server (that the gt client connects to), use,
    range coder
    crc32 checksum
    new packet for server

    listen on port with ENET_HOST_ANY (0)
    1 peer count (unless you want to multibox)
    2 channel (tr/tx)

for client (that connects to the real gt server), use,
    range coder
    crc32 checksum
    new packet

    create host with null address

    1 peer count
    2 channel

* proxy tick

wait until server data exists
wait until gt client connects
connect to gt server
start polling both server and client

if either client or server disconnects,
    disconnect from both
    back to waiting server data

if packet is receive and packet is tank and tank type is disconnect,
    disconnect the source (whoever sent that packet)
    forward it to the destination
