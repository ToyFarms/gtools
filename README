usage:

to test connectivity:
$ python main.py test

to run the proxy:
$ python main.py proxy

test:

to run the test
$ python script.py test
or
$ pytest --forked -vv

see coverage report
$ python script.py test -r

NOTE: set the environment variable `UPDATE=1` if you want to re-record the test output

to compile protobuf:
$ python script.py compile-proto

extension:

extension is used to add more feature basically.
its in a separate process talking through a broker (router) using zmq and protobuf.
if you want to make your own extension, see the example in `gtools/proxy/extension/builtin/fast_drop.py`

to run the extension:
simply run the script containing `Extension().start()` it will automatically register/wait to the proxy

to stop the extension:
simply ctrl+c, it will automatically unregister

broker/extension is restart-resistant, meaning it will automatically recover if any of them goes down
so you can safely interrupt to make some change
